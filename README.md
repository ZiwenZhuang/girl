# girl

Ha! I am implmenting my own girl, which is a collections of RL algorithms starting from bandit algorithm.

## Installation

This package should be able to utilze the same Anaconda environment as [rlpyt](https://github.com/ZiwenZhuang/rlpyt). But also, I'm putting a `environment.yml` here if you are not using rlpyt.
