# girl

Ha! I am implmenting my own girl, which is a collections of RL algorithms starting from bandit algorithm.

## Installation

1. This package should be able to utilze the same Anaconda environment as [rlpyt](https://github.com/ZiwenZhuang/rlpyt). So, if you need checking dependencies, please go and have a look. You can also take the `environment.yml` if you are lazy, but it is not garanteed it will work.

2. Install [exptools](https://github.com/ZiwenZhuang/exptools) to run experiment and visualize curves.

3. Install this repo using `pip install -e .` And do notice install in the exact conda environment you are using.
